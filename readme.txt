Collect and share color swatches, then use them in themes. Easy peasy.

== Description ==

Collect color schemes. Use 'em, display 'em, go nuts.

LB Colorbox is a new way to collect color schemes and tuck them away inside of WordPress for safe keeping. If you've ever admired the palettes available at [ColourLovers](http://www.colourlovers.com/), [StudioPress](http://www.studiopress.com/palettes), [Colllor](http://colllor.com) or elsewhere, you can now recreate that functionality from the safety of your own WordPress home.

You can also directly import color schemes from Adobe's [Kuler service](http://kuler.adobe.com/). You'll need to apply for a [Kuler API key](http://kuler.adobe.com/api/) in order to use this feature, but once you've done so, a wealth of options are available to you.
